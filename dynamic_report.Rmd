# Weather Logging 

## What's the weather up to? 

For my observational study, I tracked the weather at random times throughout the day; generally whenever I stepped outside. 

These were logged through a Google Form, which included the following questions: 

- What is the current weather condition? 
- What is the current wind strength?
- What is the current temperature in degree Celsius (째C)? 
- What is the approximate colour of the sky? 
- Do you notice any interesting or unusual atmospheric phenomena? 
  - If yes - what do you notice? 

## Summary Values:

There are currently `r observations_logged` observations logged through the form. 

The lowest temperature recorded is `r min_temp`째C, and the highest is `r max_temp`째C. The mean of the observed temperatures is `r mean_observed_temp`째C.

## Bar Charts:

```{r}
# bar graph with the weather conditions
weather_graph <- latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = weather_condition),
           fill = "#8BC4FD", colour="#FFFFFF") +
  
  # renaming the title/subtitle/axes
  labs(title = "Weather Condition",
       subtitle = "What sort of weather has it been?",
       x = "weather condition",
       y = "occurrence count")
print(weather_graph)
```

```{r}
# bar graph with the wind conditions
wind_graph <- latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = wind_strength),
           fill = "#8BC4FD", colour="#FFFFFF") +
  
  # renaming the title/subtitle/axes
  labs(title = "Wind Strength",
       subtitle = "What has the wind been like?",
       x = "wind strength",
       y = "occurrence count")
print(wind_graph)
```

```{r}
# vector containing the colours referenced in the key
sky_colours <- c("1" = "#E0E0E0",
                 "2" = "#ECECEC",
                 "3" = "#F4F1EA",
                 "4" = "#B9E1FF",
                 "5" = "#8BC4FD",
                 "6" = "#67A6EE",
                 "7" = "#5079C9",
                 "8" = "#273659",
                 "9" = "#131629",
                 "10" = "#000000")

# sky_colour is considered a numeric value, specifically a double
# however, we want to use it as a categorical value, since it is 
# a key referencing a particular hex colour
# we cannot make a bar graph from numeric values, it wants to be a histogram
# so, we can force the data in sky_colour to become a character value
# and thus be interpreted as categorical by geom_bar()
# by using the function as.character(with sky_colour as the argument)

# bar graph with the sky's colour
colour_graph <- latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = as.character(sky_colour),
               fill = as.character(sky_colour)), colour="#FFFFFF") +
  
  # manually assigning the fill to the vector sky_colours
  # so, each value passed as a character from sky_colour the column
  # is linked to a hex value in the vector, and that hex value is used to colour the graph
  scale_fill_manual(values = sky_colours, name = "sky colour") +
  
  # renaming the title/subtitle/axes
  labs(title = "Sky Colour",
       subtitle = "What colour has the sky been?",
       x = "sky colour",
       y = "occurrence count")
print(colour_graph)
```

The colours come from a key that was included in the form:

## Pictures:

Not requested in the form, but I also took pictures of all the weather occurrences I logged, and stitched them together with {magick}. Unfortunately, my camera does not handle low-light well...I promise there was nuance in real life.
